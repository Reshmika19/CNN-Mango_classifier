Project Title: Mango Classifier using CNN

Description:
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of mangoes versus other fruits. The goal is to train a model that can accurately distinguish mangoes from non-mango fruits.

The project includes the following components:

1.Dataset: The dataset consists of two classes: 'mango' and 'non-mango'. It contains a collection of labeled images of mangoes and various other fruits.

2.Model Architecture: The CNN model architecture is designed to extract relevant features from the input images using convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers for classification.

3.Training: The model is trained on the dataset using an ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation and a specified number of epochs.

4.Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set to measure its performance, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5.Prediction: The model is utilized to make predictions on new unseen images, providing a classification result of either 'Mango' or 'Non-Mango'.

The project aims to classify mangoes accurately, but there might be room for further improvements, such as increasing the dataset size, optimizing hyperparameters, or exploring advanced techniques like transfer learning.
